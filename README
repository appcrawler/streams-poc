Assumptions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Local Confluent installation available at https://www.confluent.io/download/.  This is free forever
on a single machine.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Steps
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* compile the streams software with a simple tandard maven command in this directory (streams-poc), i.e.,
	mvn 

* cd scripts

* run ./setup.sh in this directory

	setup.sh will REMOVE the existing local confluent configuration including all topics, schemas, and 
	connectors.  Ensure this is what you want before you run it!  There are other ways to do it, but
	for a repeatable test on a single machine, this is as simple as it gets.

	The script, after gutting and restarting the local confluent stack, creates topics and KSQL objects.
	It also starts two instances of the streams software we built above.  Lastly, it loads random
	customers and orders.  

* You can load data by running the produce.sh script in the scripts directory.
	Again, it is location specific, so ensure you are in the scripts directory to run produce.sh 

* You can experiemnt with interqctive queries with the check.sh script located under scripts. 
	It assumes you have a load balancer such as HAProxy listening on port 7000, and forwarding
	to ports 8080, 8180, and 8280 for the streams apps that are each listening on those port, respectively.
	If you don't have a load balancer, you can simply use thge port of any of the three and you should get the
	customer queried, regardless of whether it is located in the state store of that instance, or not.

TO-DO - clean up hardcoded references, as well as static references inside some of the classes.
