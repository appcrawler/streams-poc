compile the streams software with a standard maven command in this directory, i.e.,
mvn compile package install

cd scripts
run ./setup.sh in this directory

setup.sh will gut the existing local confluent configuration including all topics, schemas, and 
connectors.  Ensure this is what you want before you run it!

The script, after gutting and restarting the local confluent stack, creates topics and KSQL objects.
It also starts two instances of the streams software we built above.  Lastly, it loads random
customers and orders.  You can load data by running the produce.sh script in the scripts directory.
Again, it is location specific, so ensure you are in the scripts directory to run produce.sh 

TO-DO - clean up hradcoded references, as well as static references inside some of the classes.
